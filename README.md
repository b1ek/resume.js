<h1 align='center'>resume.js</h1>

Resume.JS is an in-browser CLI emulator that acts as my resume.  
Perhaps you could use this codebase to make your own resume without wasting a few days on implementing basic terminal.

This was originally a part of [homepage.js](https://git.blek.codes/blek/homepage.js), but I decided to move it to an external repository.
